# RealifyAI
Figure out if image real or generated

# Short about the project
With the rapid rise of generative AI, it's becoming difficult to tell what is real and what is fake. This challenges the ability to trust visual content and message it sends. Using RealifyAI, any image can be quickly and easily checked to see if itâ€™s real or AI-generated, by combining the strengths of a Deepfake detector and a zero-shot CLIP classifier
